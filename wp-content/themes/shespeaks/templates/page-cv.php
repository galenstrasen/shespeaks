            <h4 class="highlight"><span>WordPress Development</span></h4>
            <p>Simply speaking, I am passionate about WordPress. I have over 4 years of hands-on experience bringing WordPress websites from concept to completion, whether building themes from the ground up or expanding upon / customizing existing themes. In addition I have worked with clients to organize and design content management systems that are intuitive and educated WP newbies on how best to use the dashboard. I have a working knowledge of the WordPress core and architecture, and always keep my ear to the WordPress community for news on the latest plugins, bugs and fixes. </p>

            <h4 class="highlight"><span>Digital Production</span></h4>
            <p>A website is so much more than a static image rendered in code - a website is a system of information. I have worked with clients and team members to identify client goals, target demographics and formulate content inventories with the goal of outlining all client needs before the development process begins. This ensures that developers, designers and project managers remain in stride with client expectations and helps determine accurate project scope early on. As I have streamlined this process, it has become an invaluable component of the design, develop, deploy lifecycle.</p>
